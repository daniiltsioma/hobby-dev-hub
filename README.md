# Hobby Dev Hub

### Connect hobby developers for personal projects on volunteer basis.

**Language:** JavaScript. Front End frameworks like React and Back End libraries like Node.js allow us to biuld the entire project using a single language. We might also want to use Python, this is something we will clarify as a team during Week 3.

Development team:

* Nicholai Venetucci (npv2@pdx.edu)
