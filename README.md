# Hobby Dev Hub

### Connect hobby developers for personal projects on a volunteer basis.

**Language:** JavaScript. Front End frameworks like React and Back End libraries like Node.js allow us to build the entire project using a single language. We might also want to use Python, this is something we will clarify as a team during Week 3.

**Development strategy**: the first step will be to implement the authentication for the app. When that step is done, there will be a simple full stack app set up and ready for future development. Every developer in the team will pick up issues throughout sprints and work on them individually. We plan for each developer to do both Front and Back end work if needed.

Development team: 
* Daniil Tsioma (tsioma@pdx.edu)
* Nicholai Venetucci (npv2@pdx.edu)
* Andres Gutierrez Bravo (andg2@pdx.edu)
* Logan Brescia (lbrescia@pdx.edu)
